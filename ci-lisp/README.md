There are actually two langauges at play here:
1. The user-facing lisp (ci-sugar)
    - infix
    - multi-arg functions
    - short-names for functions. `=`, `::`, all unicode characters, etc
    - all type signatures
2. The interior lisp (ci-core)
    - none of that special stuff
    - all functions have one arg
    - dynamic types
